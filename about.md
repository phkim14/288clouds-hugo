# About the Author

## Hi, my name is Phoebe Kim, and I am a Customer Success Architect at VMware based in Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.

As a Customer Success Architect, I am focused on helping customers design and adopt VMware-based solutions to solve business challenges. Previously, I worked in technology consulting, where I was responsible for managing projects and leading teams of engineers and developers. 

When I'm not keeping busy with work or learning new technologies, I enjoy creating models for 3D printing and playing violin and piano at various events around the Dallas/Fort Worth area.
