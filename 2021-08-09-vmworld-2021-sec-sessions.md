## Tech+ Pass Only Sessions
Tech+ Pass costs $299 but it includes all the general sessions plus enhanced technical deep-dive sessions. There is a new type of VMworld session called Tech+ Tutorial. Tech+ Tutorial is a live, interactive 60-minute sessions hosted on Zoom and are probably the most technical sessions that VMworld offers. If you are into the technical details and want to have in-depth conversations about specific technology, I'd higly encourage attending these Tech+ Tutorial sessions!
