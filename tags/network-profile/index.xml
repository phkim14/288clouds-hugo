    <description><![CDATA[You can create a vRA 8 blueprint to deploy machines and place them in existing NSX-T security group(s) using a network profile.
Note that with this method, however, any and all security groups that you select in the network profile will be applied to the machines. If you have multiple machines in a blueprint and want to specify which security group each machine should use, then use vRA tag or segment port tag (refer to series part 4 &amp; 5 for those methods).]]></description>
