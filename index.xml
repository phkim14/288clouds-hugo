    <description><![CDATA[When I was starting my journey to achieve the VCDX-NV certification, I had a lot of questions. Now after going through the certification process, I thought it might be useful if I help answer some of those questions in a blogpost. Here we go!
Common FAQs Should I use NSX-V or NSX-T in my design? This is entirely up to you. Of course you have to be technical and extremely knowledgeable with the product (NSX-V or NSX-T), but remember that VCDX is an exam for architects.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[You can create a vRA Cloud blueprint to deploy machines and place them behind an on-demand NSX-T one-arm load balancer. This method creates a tier-1 router then configures load balancing services, adding virtual server, server pool, and application profile (monitor too if you want). This method should work in vRA 8.1, but I used vRA Cloud to create the demo.
Below is a simplified diagram of a NSX-T one-arm load balancer.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[You can create a vRA Cloud blueprint to deploy machines and place them behind an existing NSX-T one-arm load balancer. This method does not create any on-demand tier-1 routers. It uses the existing load balancer and simply adds virtual server, server pool, and application profile (monitor too if you want). This method should work in vRA 8.1 as well, but I used vRA Cloud to create the demo.

    <description><![CDATA[Carbon Black Cloud (CBC) can detect if an application on the company blacklist is running then send an alert and deny/terminate the process. Let&rsquo;s setup a demo using Logkeys, a linux application that stores keystrokes with or without the knowledge of user, to see how CBC reacts.
Prerequisites  Carbon Black Cloud access (Note: the environment I&rsquo;m using is Carbon Black Cloud Enterprise) A linux machine (Note: I&rsquo;m using CentOS 7) - should have administrator/root access CBC sensor installed and active on the linux machine  Process Overview  Install logkeys on the linux machine.]]></description>
