For more details on vRA integrations with external systems, please refer to the official documentation here. Git Integration vRA supports integration with GitLab, GitHub, and BitBucket repositories for you to manage blueprints and action scripts under source control. Each repository is a separate integration. In order to create an integration with GitLab or GitHub, go to “Infrastructure” then “Integrations” and click “+ ADD INTEGRATION”. You will need the server URL and token for the target repository. Once the connection is established, you configure the connection to accept blueprints in an appropriate repository by adding projects. You go to “Infrastructure” then “Integrations” then find the Git connection you’ve created. Then under the “Projects” tab, click “+ ADD PROJECT”. Once you select a project, you then configure a repository to be used for the project. You can save actions and version action scripts directly to a Git repository from vRA Cloud Assembly. With blueprints, you cannot push new or updated blueprints to a Git repository from vRA Cloud Assembly. To update a blueprint or add new blueprints to a repository, you must do this from the Git interface then import/sync the blueprints. External IPAM Integration You can create a provider-specific external IPAM integration point to use a third-party IPAM solution to manage the IP addresses used in vRA deployments. To create an IPAM integration, you go to “Infrastructure” then “Integrations”, click “+ ADD INTEGRATION” and select “IPAM”. Then you select the IPAM provider you want to use. If the IPAM provider you want to use is not available, you can click “MANAGE IPAM PROVIDERS” and import a provider-specific integration package (.zip file) from the IPAM provider’s website, VMware solutions exchange marketplace, or from vRA Cloud Assembly “Marketplace” tab if available. After selecting the IPAM provider, you need to provide more details as shown in the screenshot below. Running environment supports communication between vRA and the IPAM provider. You can use AWS or Azure cloud account or an actions-based extensibility (ABX) On-Prem Embedded integration point as a running environment. Note that if you use an AWS or Azure cloud account as a running environment, the IPAM provider appliance must be accessible from the Internet and have a publicly resolvable DNS name. MyVMware Integration You can integrate with MyVMware to support VMware related actions and capabilities with blueprints, such as accessing the VMware Marketplace. To add a MyVMware integration, you go to “Infrastructure” then “Integrations”, click “+ ADD INTEGRATION” and select “My VMware”. All you have to provide are your MyVMware credentials (username and password). vRealize Orchestrator Integration vRealize Automation has a preconfigured vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) instance that can be used for extensibility subscriptions. But with this vRO integration, you can add one or more external vRO instances and use the included workflow library in extensibility subscriptions. To add a vRO integration, go to “Infrastructure” then “Integrations”, click “+ ADD INTEGRATION” and select “vRealize Orchestrator”. You need to provide the vRO URL, a cloud proxy, as well as vRO credentials. Once the vRO integration is configured, the workflows should be added. You can see them by going to “Extensibility” then “Workflows”.

This integration must be between either both on-prem or both cloud instances of vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations. For example, you cannot integrate an on-prem vRA instance with a cloud vROPs instance. For more details on integrating vRA with vRealize Operations, please refer to the official documentation here. Advanced Workload Placement This only works on Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) enabled clusters of a vSphere cloud zone. When a machine needs to be provisioned, vRA first follows its application intent model and considers related constraints (i.e. tag-based, project membership, associated cloud zones, affinity filters, etc.) to find target resources for placement. Then out of the target resources eligible for placement given by vRA, vROPs Manager considers past and future workloads as well as what-if predictions to select which target resource is the most optimal for provisioning. vROPs Manager does not support workload placement on resource pools in a vSphere environment. For more details on advanced workload placement by the vROPs integration, please refer to the official documentation here. Deployment Monitoring vROPs Manager can monitor vRA deployments with its metrics after the vROPs integration is created. When monitoring is enabled, vRA retrieves vROPs metrics about the deployments and you can view these under “Monitor” tab for each deployment. Only vSphere virtual machine metrics (CPU, memory, storage IOPS, network MBPS) appear for the deployments. At this time, metrics from other components (i.e. vCloud Director, XaaS) or public cloud providers (i.e. AWS, Azure) are not supported. For more details on deployment monitoring by the vROPs integration, please refer to the official documentation here. Pricing Cards vRA Cloud Assembly pricing cards are used to analyze financial impact of each vRA deployment. Pricing cards define the rates for a pricing policy then the pricing policy can be assigned to specific projects to define a total price. A vROPs integration is required before you are able to create pricing cards in vRA Cloud Assembly. When a vROPs integration is created, a default rate card is available to use, and all pricing cards that are created are applied to projects by default. You can choose to create pricing cards that apply to projects only or cloud zones. To create pricing cards, you go to “Infrastructure” then “Pricing Cards” and click “+ NEW PRICING CARD”. Unfortunately, I did not have access to a vROPs cloud integration at the time of writing this post so please refer to the official documentation here for more details on pricing cards.

You use network profiles to control placement decisions to choose a network during virtual machine provisioning. By default, network profiles use the IP Address Management (IPAM) in vRA, but third-party IPAM providers, such as Infoblox, are supported. The configured IPAM solution provides IP address data and related information (i.e. DNS, gateway address) to provisioned machines. The IPAM in vRA can be managed and configured by going to “Infrastructure” then “Networks”. You can define available IP ranges under the “IP Ranges” tab and view all the IP addresses that are being tracked by the vRA IPAM under the “IP Addresses” tab. To create a network profile, go to “Infrastructure” then “Network Profiles” and click “+ NEW NETWORK PROFILE”. Under the “Summary” tab, you can choose the cloud account and give the network profile a name. Under the “Networks” tab, you can add networks where machines can be provisioned. Machines can be provisioned to existing, on-demand, or public networks. Existing network - network that already exists in the selected cloud account region Public network - network that has access to/from the Internet On-demand private network - network without outbound nor inbound traffic created by the blueprint during provisioning; network traffic is limited to occur only between the resources on this network On-demand outbound network - network that limits traffic to occur between resources deployed on this network but also allows one-way outbound network traffic On-demand routed network - network that contains a routable IP space divided across available subnets that are linked together; this specific option is only available for NSX-V and NSX-T networks You can add a common security group for all the machines deployed using this network profile. If you want a more granular security group to be applied to specific machines, you can do that from the blueprint. You can view available security groups by going to “Infrastructure” then “Security”. You can add existing load balancers to a network profile as well. Load balancers you add to a network profile are available when machines are provisioned using this network profile.

Cloud Assembly supports deploying machines to VMware vSphere, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Blueprints can be created and managed as a code using YAML. Built-in vRealize Orchestrator instance can be used to design and manage custom workflows. VMware Enterprise PKS infrastructure can be integrated with vRA to deploy Kubernetes clusters. Service Broker Service Broker offers a self-service catalog for easy consumption. Administrators can create a content source and define available templates and services for users. Administrators can create and apply policies to manage deployment lease and day 2 actions. Code Stream Code Stream is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) software. Continuous integration automates the build and test phases of application development, and continuous delivery automates the release and deploy processes to production. Developers and/or DevOps administrators can automate the entire application development release lifecycle by creating pipelines that automate build, deploy, test, and release actions in a sequence.

You have to be on video so make sure you have a decent quality camera. Make sure you have a good headset/mic so that the panelists can hear you clearly and vice versa.

Once in PowerPoint “Slide Show” mode, the presentation would show in one screen and the controls on the other, and I would share the screen with the presentation with the panelists. During the presentation, I used the presentation pen tool in PowerPoint to whiteboard as necessary. On each slide, on the top right corner, I had a symbol/image that takes me to a blank slide which I used as a whiteboard to draw things. I didn’t have any fancy pens, iPad, or Surface Book so I practiced drawing in PowerPoint with my mouse using the pen tool before the presentation. During the design scenario, I used a blank PowerPoint presentation. I used the first slide to write out the requirements, constraints, assumptions, risks, and additional notes. I created a new slide every time I wanted to draw something. I practiced doing this in mock scenarios so that I got used to creating diagrams with PowerPoint shapes. I would flip back and forth between the slides as necessary, and during the defense, I frequently went back to the first slide to make sure I was covering all the requirements.

The defense itself is already a nerve-wrecking experience so you don’t want to put additional stress on yourself by using tools that are unfamiliar or uncomfortable. I would recommend that you do couple mock defenses using the tools that you will use in the actual defense beforehand. Practice makes perfect. Good luck!

There are many great options out there, and I wanted to find a platform that won’t break the bank but is still easy to use and customize. After doing a lot of research and considering various hosting platforms (i.e. WordPress, GoDaddy, Squarespace, Bluehost, AWS, Firebase, etc.), I decided on GitHub Pages and Jekyll for the following reasons: It’s free. It’s “easy” to create. I have no need for dynamic content (at least for now). I’m enjoying it so far, but I would not recommend this to someone with no experience with web development or coding in general. GitHub Pages does not provide a GUI like WordPress or Squarespace where coding experience is not needed. Especially if you want to customize the theme and look of your website, you have to code it yourself. Even just writing a blog post, you have to write the blog in a markdown file. If you are not familiar with that format, this can be very hindering to your blogging process, which should primarily focus on creating the content, not on putting the content out. If you do have basic familiarity with web-development and git and you just need a simple static website, this can be a good option for you. So here’s how I did it… (please note that I’m using a Mac.)
