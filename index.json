On each slide, on the top right corner, I had a symbol/image that takes me to a blank slide which I used as a whiteboard to draw things. I didn’t have any fancy pens, iPad, or Surface Book so I practiced drawing in PowerPoint with my mouse using the pen tool before the presentation. During the design scenario, I used a blank PowerPoint presentation. I used the first slide to write out the requirements, constraints, assumptions, risks, and additional notes. I created a new slide every time I wanted to draw something. I practiced doing this in mock scenarios so that I got used to creating diagrams with PowerPoint shapes. I would flip back and forth between the slides as necessary, and during the defense, I frequently went back to the first slide to make sure I was covering all the requirements.

There are many great options out there, and I wanted to find a platform that won’t break the bank but is still easy to use and customize. After doing a lot of research and considering various hosting platforms (i.e. WordPress, GoDaddy, Squarespace, Bluehost, AWS, Firebase, etc.), I decided on GitHub Pages and Jekyll for the following reasons: It’s free. It’s “easy” to create. I have no need for dynamic content (at least for now). I’m enjoying it so far, but I would not recommend this to someone with no experience with web development or coding in general. GitHub Pages does not provide a GUI like WordPress or Squarespace where coding experience is not needed. Especially if you want to customize the theme and look of your website, you have to code it yourself. Even just writing a blog post, you have to write the blog in a markdown file. If you are not familiar with that format, this can be very hindering to your blogging process, which should primarily focus on creating the content, not on putting the content out. If you do have basic familiarity with web-development and git and you just need a simple static website, this can be a good option for you. So here’s how I did it… (please note that I’m using a Mac.)
