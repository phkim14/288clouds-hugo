    <description><![CDATA[When I was starting my journey to achieve the VCDX-NV certification, I had a lot of questions. Now after going through the certification process, I thought it might be useful if I help answer some of those questions in a blogpost. Here we go!
Common FAQs Should I use NSX-V or NSX-T in my design? This is entirely up to you. Of course you have to be technical and extremely knowledgeable with the product (NSX-V or NSX-T), but remember that VCDX is an exam for architects.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[You can create a vRA Cloud blueprint to deploy machines and place them behind an on-demand NSX-T one-arm load balancer. This method creates a tier-1 router then configures load balancing services, adding virtual server, server pool, and application profile (monitor too if you want). This method should work in vRA 8.1, but I used vRA Cloud to create the demo.
Below is a simplified diagram of a NSX-T one-arm load balancer.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[You can create a vRA Cloud blueprint to deploy machines and place them behind an existing NSX-T one-arm load balancer. This method does not create any on-demand tier-1 routers. It uses the existing load balancer and simply adds virtual server, server pool, and application profile (monitor too if you want). This method should work in vRA 8.1 as well, but I used vRA Cloud to create the demo.

    <description><![CDATA[Remote VCDX defense option has normally been reserved for candidates attempting to achieve their second, third, or even fourth VCDX. But in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, having a remote VCDX defense seems to be a possibility for candidates trying to receive their first VCDX in some cases.
I got my VCDX in January 2020 through a remote defense, and I thought it may be valuable to share what I&rsquo;ve used during my defense for candidates who may have remote defenses in the future.]]></description>
