The network tag must be in use by at least one firewall rule for it to be discovered by vRA during data collection. Below is an example of a network tag applied to an existing instance in GCP. Note that a GCP network tag is not a separate resource by itself. You can only create a GCP network tag when you’re creating an instance or if you’re adding a new network tag to an existing instance. For example, when you’re creating an instance, find the “Networking” section and you can create tags under “Network tags”. In vRA Cloud Assembly, go to “Resources” \u003e “Security” and add a vRA tag to the GCP network tag you’d like to use in a vRA template. If you’ve just made a new network tag in GCP, you might have to wait until another data collection has been done for that GCP environment. Data collection occurs every 10 minutes automatically. You can check when the last data collection has been done by viewing the cloud account details from “Infrastructure” \u003e “Cloud Accounts” in vRA Cloud Assembly. In a vRA Cloud template in vRA Cloud Assembly, drag a Cloud Agnostic Security Group resource on the canvas and connect it to the machine you’d like to apply the GCP network tag. I only use one security group in this example but you can have multiple security groups attached to one machine. Under constraints:, add the line - tag: \u003cinsert tag name\u003e. Make sure the value for securityGroupType is existing. Creating on-demand security groups (or GCP network tags) is not supported with GCP. If you try to set the value for securityGroupType as new and deploy the template, it will fail and give the error like below. Verify Deployment After you deploy the template and the deployment is finished, go to the GCP UI \u003e “Compute Engine” \u003e “VM instances” and click instance that has been created by the vRA deployment. Scroll down to “Network interfaces” section and click “View details”. Under “VM instance details” \u003e “Network tags”, you should see that the network tag has been applied by the vRA template on this instance.

For a Cloud Agnostic Network resource, there are two on-demand network types: private and outbound.

It only allows traffic to occur between machines deployed on this same network. Outbound network block ingress traffic but allows egress traffic. NAT occurs at the tier-1 router. Routed network allows machines deployed on the network to communicate with other networks that are attached to the same tier-1 router or other routes that are routable with the tier-1 router.

If you choose networkType: outbound, vRA creates a tier-1 logical router and attaches it to an existing tier-0 logical router that you specify in the network profile. This tier-1 logical router will advertise NAT routes. vRA creates a NSX-T segment and attaches it to the tier-1 logical router that has been created.

Also, at this time, you can only select the default compute gateway provided by the VMC on AWS SDDC for the network domain in the network profile. So if you choose networkType: private in a vRA cloud template and deploy it to a VMC on AWS environment using the network profile (like the sample shown in the image above), vRA will create a NSX-T segment on demand according to the network profile, but it will attach it to the default compute gateway, making it a routed network. If you want to create on-demand networks that are truly private or outbound, you have the following options at this time: Option 1. Create an existing security group with appropriate firewall rules for the network type that you want. Apply this existing security group in the vRA cloud template that creates on-demand networks. Option 2. Create a new security group with appropriate on-demand firewall rules for the network type that you want in the vRA cloud template that creates on-demand networks. If you’d like more information on how you can create on-demand firewall rules in VMC on AWS with vRA cloud template, you can refer to another blog post here.

You will see that a new section has been created with rules that deny all inbound and outbound traffic to the newly created security group so that the machines in this security group are isolated. Note that if you set the networkType as outbound, the outbound rule created in this section will be “Allow” instead of “Reject”.

You select a policy type that you want to create: Approval Policy Day 2 Actions Policy Lease Policy Approval Policy An approval policy defines when approvals are required and who must approve the request before the request is provisioned. Scope The scope determines whether the policy will be applied to all deployments in the organization or to deployments in a selected project. Deployment Criteria You can provide deployment criteria if you want to refine the deployments to which the policy will be applied. Deployment criteria format is as follows: clause + operator + value Clause options: cloudTemplate, catalogItem, deployment, ownedBy, requestedBy, resources Operator options (depends on selected clause): equals, not equal to, has any Below is an example where a specific project has been selected for scope and deployment criteria has been added where this approval policy will only be applied to deployments requested by a user, phoebek (me). Approver Mode You can choose “Any” or “All” for the Approver mode. Any - only one approver needs to approve for the request to be processed All - all the listed approvers must respond with the same response for the request to be processed; if at least one approver rejects the request, the request will be denied Approvers You can add one or more users as approvers. All approvers must have at least organization members and the Service Broker user roles. The approval request will be sent to all the approvers simultaneously. Auto Expiry Decision \u0026 Trigger You can choose to automatically approve or reject a request after a specific number of days has passed. You set the decision to approve or reject by configuring the Auto expiry decision field. You set the number of days in the Auto expiry trigger field. The max number of days you can set is 7 days. Actions You select one or more actions that this policy applies to. You can find actions by entering the deployment or resource type in the search box. You can use an asterisk as a wildcard after a string as well. Day 2 Actions Policy A day 2 actions policy controls what group of users can run a selected list of actions on deployed resources. Enforcement Type You can choose this day 2 actions policy enforcement type to be either hard or soft. Hard policies will be ranked higher than soft policies so soft policies can be overridden by hard policies. Role Role entitles the members of the selected role, within the selected scope and deployment criteria, to be able to run the selected actions. The role can be a project administrator, a project member, or a named custom role. Lease Policy A lease policy controls how long the provisioned workloads are active before they are destroyed and resources can be reclaimed. Maximum Lease (days) You can set the maximum number of days a deployment can exist without being renewed. The lease begins when the deployment is created. Maximum Total Lease (days) You can set the maximum number of days a deployment can exist, including lease renewals. Users can renew leases until the deployment reaches the maximum total lease day, then the deployment is destroyed and resources are reclaimed. Grace Period (days) You can set the number of days after a lease expires before it is destroyed. It gives an opportunity for users to extend the lease for another block of time, as long as it does not exceed the maximum Total Lease value.

This separation provides flexible and rapid deployments. Kubernetes offers some of the following benefits: Autoscaling deployments with an automatic configuration of load balancers Enabling simple tasks and systems to run as isolated functions, allowing for dynamic and agile deployments Built-in health checks with automatic actions and rebuilding of unresponsive machines Basic knowledge of Kubernetes is important for vRealize Automation because vRealize Automation 8.x is established in a Kubernetes cluster. Here are some of the basic concepts of Kubernetes architecture: Kubernetes cluster is the main level with at least oen master API server and at least one worker node. The worker node(s) host pods, which are virtual container sets. A pod is usually a Docker engine that runs one or more containers. A pod offers the capability to isolate the application layer from the machine. Communication between pods is handled through a proxy server for rapid communication with little overhead. A container is the smallest form of Kubernetes; it is similar to a virtual machine in vSphere vCenter. For more details on Kubernetes, please refer to Kubernetes official documentation here.

CloudConfig CloudConfig is a section in the VMware YAML blueprint code where you can add machine initialize commands that run at deployment time. You use initialization commands to customize users, permissions, installations, and more (i.e. set a hostname, install packages, etc.). For linux, cloud-init standard is used For Windows, Cloudbase-init commands are used Couple things to note when using cloudConfig: Linux cloud-init and Windows Cloudbase-init do not share the same syntax. Therefore, a cloudConfig section for a linux OS would not work in a machine image of another OS. If you are deploying a vSphere machine with cloudConfig, it must have a DHCP IP address. Static IP addresses are not allowed because the VM template must have a live connection to the network before the cloudConfig scripts can run. Therefore, DHCP must be used. Do not use a vSphere customization specification with a blueprint that uses cloudConfig. cloudConfig is not compatible with vSphere customization specification. cloudConfig in a Blueprint The cloudConfig: section should line up with other parts of the machine properties (i.e. image, flavor, networks, etc.). You need a pipe character after the cloudConfig directive. All the commands after this pipe character will be sent to the virtual machine cloud-init software after the image is deployed. These commands run only on the first boot. cloudConfig in an Image Mapping You can also add cloudConfig scripts to an image mapping, but these commands cannot be interactive since inputs are not allowed. If you want to add cloudConfig scripts to an image mapping, go to “Infrastructure” and “Image Mappings” then click “+ ADD” under “Cloud Configuration”. You then write the cloud configuration script for image mapping. Note that if you have cloudConfig commands in both an image mapping and a blueprint, the commands are combined into a single list of commands. If there is a conflict between those two sets of cloudConfig commands, the directives in the image mapping take precedence. If you want to learn more about cloud-init and see some cloud config examples, please refer to the cloud-init official documentation here. Cloud-init Cloud-init is a set of Python scripts that initialize cloud instances of linux machines; it configures SSH keys and runs commands to customize the machine without any user interaction. By default, cloud-init is available in Ubuntu 18 and Photon 3. For CentOS or other versions of Ubuntu and Photon, you need to install cloud-init. Note that not all operating systems support all cloud-init commands. Output from cloud-init is found in in the /var/log/cloud-init-output.log file after the deployment is completed. The main log file is at /var/log/cloud-init.log. If you’re having trouble with a cloud-init script, use these logs for troubleshooting. Create a vSphere Template that Supports Cloud-init (Example) This is an example procedure to create a CentOS cloud-init template in vSphere. Create/deploy a CentOS VM in a vSphere environment Open the CentOS console and login with root account Install the cloud-init software: yum install -y cloud-init Install Perl: yum install -y perl Note: cloud-init and Perl are already installed on Ubuntu 18 but they must be installed manually in CentOS or other versions of Ubuntu. To install cloud-init in Ubuntu, use apt-get install cloud-init. Create a file using Nano or vi: /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-custom-networking.cfg Add a line to the 99-custom-networking.cfg file: network: {config: disabled} Save the 99-custom-networking.cfg file This file takes network control away from cloud-init. This file is not needed if you’re making an Ubuntu OS template. Clean the virtual machine: cloud-init clean Do not do anything else on the virtual machine after running this command.

The components pane is on the left, and it lists all the different components that you can drag and drop onto the design canvas. When you add an element to the design canvas, YAML code corresponding to that element will appear in the the YAML pane on the right. If you choose to write the YAML code first, the corresponding element will appear on the design canvas. The YAML pane editor will help you with syntax and options.

During provisioning, vRA Cloud Assembly matches all the capability tags with constraint tags in the blueprint to define the deployment configuration. Below is a high-level overview of how vRA Cloud Assembly uses tags to define a deployment: Filter cloud zones by criteria (i.e. availability, profiles) then by zone and compute capability tags with hard constraints From this filtered list of cloud zones, use priority to select a cloud zone; if all the cloud zones have the same priority, they are sorted by matching soft constraints (cloud zone and compute capabilities) Select a host in the selected cloud zone by matching hard and soft constraints expressed in the blueprint It is crucial to develop a tag strategy and tagging conventions to minimize confusion among users who create and use tags in vRA Cloud Assembly. Here are some best practices to create an effective tag strategy: Design a tag strategy that aligns with the structure of your business Use simple and meaningful names and values for tags so that it is intuitive for the users to understand Do not create duplicate or extraneous/unused tags To create a tag strategy that aligns with the structure of your business, you should consider your specific use cases and think about some of the following questions: How many different types of environments (i.e. production, test, dev, etc.) will you deploy to? How many different cloud zones will you deploy to? How are the compute resources structured for deployments? Are there different operating systems for deployments? How many storage options are available for deployments? Are there storage tiers for different types of deployments? How many networking options are available for deployments? Capability Tags You create capability tags on compute resources, cloud zones, images, networks, network profiles, etc. If you add capability tags to cloud zones and network profiles, the tags affect all resources within those zones and profiles. If you add capability tags to storage or network components, the tags affect only the components where the tags have been applied. When you create capability tags, you should already know how you are going to create appropriate blueprint constraints since vRA Cloud Assembly matches capability tags with constraints on blueprints. Constraint Tags Tags added to projects and blueprints are constraint tags. They are matched to capability tags on resources, profiles, and cloud zones to define deployment configurations. Cloud administrators can use constraint tags on projects to apply convernance at the project level. If there is a conflict between a project constraint tag and a blueprint constraint tag, the project constraint tag takes precedence.

You can create an onboarding plan, select existing machines manually or by using a filtering rule, then run the plan to import the machines. You can onboard up to 3,500 unmanaged machines within a single onboarding plan per hour. You can onboard up to 17,000 unmanaged machines concurrently with multiple onboarding plans per hour. The person who runs the workload onboarding plan is automatically assigned as the machine owner. To create an onboarding plan, you go to “Infrastructure” then “Onboarding” and click “NEW ONBOARDING PLAN”. You then select the cloud account from where you want to onboard machines as well as a project with at least one user to associate the new deployments with. Once an onboarding plan is created, you can manually select machines to add to the plan under “Machines” tab. If you manually select machines, you can choose how to transform those machines into deployments. You can either have each machine be its own deployment, put all the selected machines into one deployment, add the machines to an existing plan deployment in the current onboarding plan, or add the machines to an existing deployment in vRA Cloud Assembly. You can also create a filtering rule using properties, such as name, address, or tags, to populate machines into the plan under the “Rules” tab. After you create a filtering rule, you can go to the “Machines” tab to view the machines that have been added to the plan by the filtering rule. Once machines have been added to the plan, you can go to the “Deployments” tab and view the deployments that will be created from this plan. Note that if you use a filtering rule to add machines, each machine will be its own separate deployment. In the “Deployments” tab, you can also select the deployments and choose to create blueprints (now called cloud templates) in Cloud Assembly format. Each deployment creates its own corresponding blueprint. Note that if you are onboarding a vsphere machine, you need to edit the blueprint imageRef: field with the correct template name. You can do this while creating the onboarding plan or update the blueprint after the onboarding process is complete. For more details on onboarding, please refer to the official documentation here.

Multiple tags can be attached to the same resource. The following resources can have tags attached: Cloud zones Compute resources Network profiles Storage profiles You use tags in blueprints to select which resource is used, and therefore, tags are very important in vRA 8.x. Tags can be used to organize resources by: Capability (i.e. speed of network, speed or expense of storage, purpose of a cloud zone, etc.) Location (geographical division) Type (i.e. platform type like AWS or GCP, environment purpose like production or dev, etc.) Other criteria (i.e. department, division) You manage tags from “Infrastructure” then “Tags”. Note that vRA tags are not the same as vSphere tags. They are not directly related to one another. vRA does not collect vSphere tags during data inventory collection. Capability VS. Constraint Tags There are 2 different types of tags: capability and constraint. Capability Tags A capability tag is placed on a specific resource to indicate a capability. It can be placed on resources, cloud zones, storage profiles, and network profiles. Capability tags are matched to blueprint constraint tags during provisioning. Below is an example of a capability tag defined for a cloud zone. The capability tag here would be applied to all compute resources in this cloud zone. Although the capability tag is applied to all compute resources in a cloud zone, the tag does not show as one of the tags when you view the compute resource under the “Compute” resources tab. Constraint Tags A constraint tag is a key:value tag used in a blueprint (in YAML) or a project, and it forces a deployment to deploy only on resources where a capability tag matches the constraint. Below is an example of a constraint tag used in a blueprint. To define constraint tags in a project, you go to “Infrastructure” and “Projects”. From there, select a project you want to edit and go to the “Provisioning” tab to add constraint tags. A project constraint tag can be a hard or a soft constraint by specifying key:value:hard or key:value:soft respectively. By default, project constraint tags are hard constraints. If a hard constraint is not met, the deployment will fail. The deployment will not fail if a soft constraint is not met since a soft constraint is a preference. You can also avoid deploying to specific resources by creating a project constraint tag in a !key:value format. Note that if there is a conflict between a project constraint tag and a blueprint constraint tag, the project constraint tag takes precedence.

There you just enter your tag in the text box. The capability tag will be applied to all networks in the network profile. You can also create a tag under “Infrastructure” and “Tags” then search and select an existing tag to add as a capability tag.

You then use vRSLCM to create and configure tenants. Enabling tenancy creates a new Provider organization by default, and the Provider Admin can create new tenants, add tenant admins, setup directory synchronization, and add users. Tenant admins have control over their tenant; they can control directory synchronization, add users, configure policies, access content and provisioned resources, and more within their tenant. By default, multi-tenancy is enabled based on tenant hostname so unlike previous vRA versions (7.x) where users accessed tenants with URLs based on directory path, users now will access tenants based on hostname.

For more details on vRA integrations with external systems, please refer to the official documentation here. Git Integration vRA supports integration with GitLab, GitHub, and BitBucket repositories for you to manage blueprints and action scripts under source control. Each repository is a separate integration. In order to create an integration with GitLab or GitHub, go to “Infrastructure” then “Integrations” and click “+ ADD INTEGRATION”. You will need the server URL and token for the target repository. Once the connection is established, you configure the connection to accept blueprints in an appropriate repository by adding projects. You go to “Infrastructure” then “Integrations” then find the Git connection you’ve created. Then under the “Projects” tab, click “+ ADD PROJECT”. Once you select a project, you then configure a repository to be used for the project. You can save actions and version action scripts directly to a Git repository from vRA Cloud Assembly. With blueprints, you cannot push new or updated blueprints to a Git repository from vRA Cloud Assembly. To update a blueprint or add new blueprints to a repository, you must do this from the Git interface then import/sync the blueprints. External IPAM Integration You can create a provider-specific external IPAM integration point to use a third-party IPAM solution to manage the IP addresses used in vRA deployments. To create an IPAM integration, you go to “Infrastructure” then “Integrations”, click “+ ADD INTEGRATION” and select “IPAM”. Then you select the IPAM provider you want to use. If the IPAM provider you want to use is not available, you can click “MANAGE IPAM PROVIDERS” and import a provider-specific integration package (.zip file) from the IPAM provider’s website, VMware solutions exchange marketplace, or from vRA Cloud Assembly “Marketplace” tab if available. After selecting the IPAM provider, you need to provide more details as shown in the screenshot below. Running environment supports communication between vRA and the IPAM provider. You can use AWS or Azure cloud account or an actions-based extensibility (ABX) On-Prem Embedded integration point as a running environment. Note that if you use an AWS or Azure cloud account as a running environment, the IPAM provider appliance must be accessible from the Internet and have a publicly resolvable DNS name. MyVMware Integration You can integrate with MyVMware to support VMware related actions and capabilities with blueprints, such as accessing the VMware Marketplace. To add a MyVMware integration, you go to “Infrastructure” then “Integrations”, click “+ ADD INTEGRATION” and select “My VMware”. All you have to provide are your MyVMware credentials (username and password). vRealize Orchestrator Integration vRealize Automation has a preconfigured vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) instance that can be used for extensibility subscriptions. But with this vRO integration, you can add one or more external vRO instances and use the included workflow library in extensibility subscriptions. To add a vRO integration, go to “Infrastructure” then “Integrations”, click “+ ADD INTEGRATION” and select “vRealize Orchestrator”. You need to provide the vRO URL, a cloud proxy, as well as vRO credentials. Once the vRO integration is configured, the workflows should be added. You can see them by going to “Extensibility” then “Workflows”.

This integration must be between either both on-prem or both cloud instances of vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations. For example, you cannot integrate an on-prem vRA instance with a cloud vROPs instance. For more details on integrating vRA with vRealize Operations, please refer to the official documentation here. Advanced Workload Placement This only works on Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) enabled clusters of a vSphere cloud zone. When a machine needs to be provisioned, vRA first follows its application intent model and considers related constraints (i.e. tag-based, project membership, associated cloud zones, affinity filters, etc.) to find target resources for placement. Then out of the target resources eligible for placement given by vRA, vROPs Manager considers past and future workloads as well as what-if predictions to select which target resource is the most optimal for provisioning. vROPs Manager does not support workload placement on resource pools in a vSphere environment. For more details on advanced workload placement by the vROPs integration, please refer to the official documentation here. Deployment Monitoring vROPs Manager can monitor vRA deployments with its metrics after the vROPs integration is created. When monitoring is enabled, vRA retrieves vROPs metrics about the deployments and you can view these under “Monitor” tab for each deployment. Only vSphere virtual machine metrics (CPU, memory, storage IOPS, network MBPS) appear for the deployments. At this time, metrics from other components (i.e. vCloud Director, XaaS) or public cloud providers (i.e. AWS, Azure) are not supported. For more details on deployment monitoring by the vROPs integration, please refer to the official documentation here. Pricing Cards vRA Cloud Assembly pricing cards are used to analyze financial impact of each vRA deployment. Pricing cards define the rates for a pricing policy then the pricing policy can be assigned to specific projects to define a total price. A vROPs integration is required before you are able to create pricing cards in vRA Cloud Assembly. When a vROPs integration is created, a default rate card is available to use, and all pricing cards that are created are applied to projects by default. You can choose to create pricing cards that apply to projects only or cloud zones. To create pricing cards, you go to “Infrastructure” then “Pricing Cards” and click “+ NEW PRICING CARD”. Unfortunately, I did not have access to a vROPs cloud integration at the time of writing this post so please refer to the official documentation here for more details on pricing cards.

You use network profiles to control placement decisions to choose a network during virtual machine provisioning. By default, network profiles use the IP Address Management (IPAM) in vRA, but third-party IPAM providers, such as Infoblox, are supported. The configured IPAM solution provides IP address data and related information (i.e. DNS, gateway address) to provisioned machines. The IPAM in vRA can be managed and configured by going to “Infrastructure” then “Networks”. You can define available IP ranges under the “IP Ranges” tab and view all the IP addresses that are being tracked by the vRA IPAM under the “IP Addresses” tab. To create a network profile, go to “Infrastructure” then “Network Profiles” and click “+ NEW NETWORK PROFILE”. Under the “Summary” tab, you can choose the cloud account and give the network profile a name. Under the “Networks” tab, you can add networks where machines can be provisioned. Machines can be provisioned to existing, on-demand, or public networks. Existing network - network that already exists in the selected cloud account region Public network - network that has access to/from the Internet On-demand private network - network without outbound nor inbound traffic created by the blueprint during provisioning; network traffic is limited to occur only between the resources on this network On-demand outbound network - network that limits traffic to occur between resources deployed on this network but also allows one-way outbound network traffic On-demand routed network - network that contains a routable IP space divided across available subnets that are linked together; this specific option is only available for NSX-V and NSX-T networks You can add a common security group for all the machines deployed using this network profile. If you want a more granular security group to be applied to specific machines, you can do that from the blueprint. You can view available security groups by going to “Infrastructure” then “Security”. You can add existing load balancers to a network profile as well. Load balancers you add to a network profile are available when machines are provisioned using this network profile.

A user can have multiple roles. In vRA, there are 2 types of roles: Organization roles: These are defined at the topmost vRA level. There are two organization roles - organization owner and organization member. An organization owner has access to Services, Identity \u0026 Access Management, and Branding tabs. The main responsibility of an organization owner is to assign roles to the organization members. An organization member only has access to the Services tab. Service roles: These roles define user access to different services available with vRA, including Cloud Assembly, Code Stream, Orchestrator, and Service Broker. Each service has multiple roles available. Only one organization can exist in a vRealize Automation deployment. Every vRA user given a service role must first be associated with an organization role. As an organization owner, you can navigate to the “Identity \u0026 Access Management” tab from the vRA Cloud Services Console and manage acive users and enterprise groups. You can assign and edit roles for a specific user from the “Identity \u0026 Access Management” tab by selecting a user then clicking “Edit Roles”. You can assign multiple service roles to one user.

Cloud Assembly Cloud Assembly is used to create blueprints (or now called templates) and deploy machines, applications, and services to multiple clouds. Cloud Assembly supports deploying machines to VMware vSphere, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Blueprints can be created and managed as a code using YAML. Built-in vRealize Orchestrator instance can be used to design and manage custom workflows. VMware Enterprise PKS infrastructure can be integrated with vRA to deploy Kubernetes clusters. Service Broker Service Broker offers a self-service catalog for easy consumption. Administrators can create a content source and define available templates and services for users. Administrators can create and apply policies to manage deployment lease and day 2 actions. Code Stream Code Stream is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) software. Continuous integration automates the build and test phases of application development, and continuous delivery automates the release and deploy processes to production. Developers and/or DevOps administrators can automate the entire application development release lifecycle by creating pipelines that automate build, deploy, test, and release actions in a sequence. Code Stream supports Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and VMware vSphere.

Once in PowerPoint “Slide Show” mode, the presentation would show in one screen and the controls on the other, and I would share the screen with the presentation with the panelists. During the presentation, I used the presentation pen tool in PowerPoint to whiteboard as necessary. On each slide, on the top right corner, I had a symbol/image that takes me to a blank slide which I used as a whiteboard to draw things. I didn’t have any fancy pens, iPad, or Surface Book so I practiced drawing in PowerPoint with my mouse using the pen tool before the presentation. During the design scenario, I used a blank PowerPoint presentation. I used the first slide to write out the requirements, constraints, assumptions, risks, and additional notes. I created a new slide every time I wanted to draw something. I practiced doing this in mock scenarios so that I got used to creating diagrams with PowerPoint shapes. I would flip back and forth between the slides as necessary, and during the defense, I frequently went back to the first slide to make sure I was covering all the requirements.

There are many great options out there, and I wanted to find a platform that won’t break the bank but is still easy to use and customize. After doing a lot of research and considering various hosting platforms (i.e. WordPress, GoDaddy, Squarespace, Bluehost, AWS, Firebase, etc.), I decided on GitHub Pages and Jekyll for the following reasons: It’s free. It’s “easy” to create. I have no need for dynamic content (at least for now). I’m enjoying it so far, but I would not recommend this to someone with no experience with web development or coding in general. GitHub Pages does not provide a GUI like WordPress or Squarespace where coding experience is not needed. Especially if you want to customize the theme and look of your website, you have to code it yourself. Even just writing a blog post, you have to write the blog in a markdown file. If you are not familiar with that format, this can be very hindering to your blogging process, which should primarily focus on creating the content, not on putting the content out. If you do have basic familiarity with web-development and git and you just need a simple static website, this can be a good option for you. So here’s how I did it… (please note that I’m using a Mac.)
